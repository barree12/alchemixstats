          Tokemak is a decentralized market making platform and a liquidity router.
          <br/>There are currently two Alchemix-related reactors (pools) in Tokemak, one for ALCX, the other for alUSD. Users can deposit ALCX or alUSD and earn a yield on them in Tokemakâ€™s native asset, TOKE.
          <br/>The system then pairs these assets with other tokens in Tokemak, such as ETH, USDC or any other asset that is voted for, creating trading pairs on decentralized exchanges.
          <br/>It is important to note that while these assets are deployed in liquidity pools, Tokemak provides protection from IL (Impermanent Loss) through their mechanics.
